# REFERENCE GRAPH

#### Video Demo:
#### Description:
This is a dynamic, web-based reference graph. I created this app to solve my issue of using up precious storage space from downloaded images, documents, and other files. This app is designed to let you annotate images/docs and lets you organize what you upload or link from other websites into a network (with nodes and links) rather than a board. My app is a visual tracking solution that accompanies your work, whether that's a research paper, an illustration, or an investigation.
